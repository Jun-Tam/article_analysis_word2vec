# Article trend Analysis by word2vec

### Summary
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates application example of NLP to energy-industry articles in PDF. <br>

### Part1: Preprocessing
Preprocessing part is described: conversion from PDF to text, tokenizer, duplicate file deletion. <br>
About 600 articles were collected and converted into text files. <br>

### Part2: Trend Analysis
Analysis part is described: BoW, IDF/TF, word2vec, WordCloud

Using word2vec "ness" vectors are defined, and each article is converted into ness vectors. <br>
The time-series plots below show recent article trends for individual ness vectors along with oil price history. <br>
